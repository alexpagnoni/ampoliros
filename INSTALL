1. REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must have root access in order to install Ampoliros into Unix systems.

Ampoliros requires a web server with PHP 4 support and a
SQL server supported by Ampoliros.

Ampoliros encoded version requires Zend Optimizer to run.

Ampoliros is certified to work with these applications:

Operating systems:
- GNU/Linux Slackware 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1 - Debian 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
- Microsoft Windows 9x/NT/2000 (lacks cron support for now)
- Red Hat Linux 7.3

SQL servers:
- PostgreSQL 7.0+ (7.1+ higly reccomended)
- MySQL 3.22+

Web servers:
- Apache 1.3.14+ (it should work with previous 1.3.x versions too)

PHP environment:
- PHP 4.1.0+
- File upload support (required)
- XML support (required)
- DOM XML support (required)
- ZLib support (required)
- Zend Optimizer (optional)

Misc:
Ampoliros has also been tested on Windows systems with PHPTriad and FoxServ.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. HOW TO INSTALL (UNIX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Login as root:

su - root

- Unpack Ampoliros tarball distribution:

tar xfz ampoliros-x.x.x.tgz

where x.x.x is current version. Unpacking it in a temporary directory
(like /tmp) is a good idea.

- Launch configure script and answer questions:

./configure

- Launch make:

make

If something goes wrong, just launch "make remove", adjust
the settings (you can also change config.h file directly) and retry
make.

- Tune PHP configuration by adding a new directory in the include_path
directive, relative to [private directory]/etc. and increase the max
upload size limit.

e.g.

include_path = ".:/usr/local/ampoliros/etc"
upload_max_filesize = 4M

- Tune web server configuration, adding an alias for Ampoliros cgi
public directory. In Apache this is done with:

Alias /ampcgi/ "Ampoliros cgi public directory here"

e.g.

Alias /ampcgi/ "/var/www/ampoliros/cgi/"

and restart Apache.

- Files installation is now done.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. HOW TO INSTALL (WINDOWS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Launch Ampoliros installer.

- Setup Ampoliros configuration with AmpCfg, it will be automatically
executed by the installer at the end of the installation.

- Ampoliros public directory must be made accessible by the web server.
You can move "public" directory into the document root of your web server,
and then reconfigure Ampoliros with AmpCfg to match the new directory
placement. A good choice is to rename public directory to "ampoliros".

- Tune PHP configuration by adding a new directory in the include_path
directive, relative to [private directory]\etc. and increase the max
upload size limit.

e.g.

include_path = ".;c:\programs\ampoliros\etc"
upload_max_filesize = 4M

- Tune web server configuration, adding an alias for Ampoliros cgi
public directory. In Apache this is done with:

Alias /ampcgi/ "Ampoliros cgi public directory here"

e.g.

Alias /ampcgi/ "c:/apache/htdocs/ampoliros/cgi/"

and restart Apache.

- Files installation is now done.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. HOW TO UPGRADE (ALL PLATFORMS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since Ampoliros sees itself as a module (from version 2.5.0), to upgrade an
existing Ampoliros installation all you have to do is to enter Ampoliros root
administration area and then upload Ampoliros archive in Module section, like
any other module.
